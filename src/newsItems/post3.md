With the release of the Fujifilm GFX 100S seemingly imminent, we're not surprised to see more details being leaked. However, this particular piece of information is sure to send excited ripples through the medium format community. Apparently, the Fujifilm GFX 100S will cost just $5,999.

According to Fuji Rumors, this makes it a full $500 cheaper than the Fujifilm GFX 50S when it was first launched, which had a RRP of $6,500. This means that if the rumors are correct, the Fujifilm GFX 100S will have a 102MP medium format sensor, Phase Detect AF, in-body image stabilization and a back-illuminated sensor – all for under $6,000. That's certainly nothing to sniff at! 

It seems clear the Fujifilm has been gearing up for a big announcement for a while – and now we finally have an unofficial date to look forward to. Apparently, we'll be seeing Fujifilm announce a whole host of different gear on 27 January.

Not only is the Fujifilm GFX 100S and the Fujifilm X-E4 rumored to appear on 27 January, but there will also be a collection of lenses and a new Fujifilm film simulation announced as well.
