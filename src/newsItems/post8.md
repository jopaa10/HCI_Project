We first reported on Sony's plan to enter the drone market back in November 2020, but at that point all we had was the name – AirPeak – and a teaser video showing little more than a logo.

But the Sony CES 2021 keynote presentation on the first day of the major electronics show revealed pictures of the new drone system and gave a hint of its capabilities.

Presented by Mr Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony Chairman, President and CEO, the Airpeak drone on display is a professional four-rotor drone capable of lifting what looks like a full frame Sony mirrorless camera.
