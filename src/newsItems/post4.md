Filter specialist NiSi has announced its first ever lens, the NiSi 4/15 â€“ a 15mm f/4 ultra-wide optic for Canon RF, Nikon Z, Sony E and Fujifilm X mount. 

Already many people's choice for the best ND filters and best polarizers, the NiSi is now turning its expertise in optics towards camera lenses with the NiSi 4/15. And while those looking for the best wide-angle lens are already spoiled for choice, the native RF and Z mounts make this a particularly compelling option for mirrorless users upgrading to Canon and Nikon's new systems.

The NiSi 4/15 features a 15mm focal length on full frame bodies, or an equivalent 22mm on APS-C cameras. Its optical formula features 12 elements in 10 groups, including one aspherical and two extra-low dispersion elements. 

As you might expect it's a fully manual lens, with a dedicated focus and aperture ring. NiSi is keen to state how good the optic is for shooting sunstars and starbursts, thanks to its 10 straight diaphragm blades (with a minimum aperture of f/22).
