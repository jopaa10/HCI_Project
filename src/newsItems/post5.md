The Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III is officially the top-selling camera in Japan for 2020, based on sales figures that have recently been published by retail company BCN+R. 

Publishing data that accounts for approximately 40% of Japan's sales market, BCN+R (via PetaPixel) has regularly remained a useful indicator of Japan's market trends. It also included the nine other cameras that were on the top 10 best-selling cameras list:

Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III EZ Double Zoom Kit Silver
Canon EOS Kiss M Double Zoom Kit White
Olympus PEN E-PL9 EZ Double Zoom Kit White
Sony a6400 Double Zoom Lens Kit Black
Canon EOS Kiss M Double Zoom Kit Black
Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III EZ Double Zoom Kit Black
Sony a6400 Double Zoom Lens Kit Silver
Panasonic LUMIX GF9 Double Lens Kit Orange
Nikon Z 50 Double Zoom Kit
Sony a6100 Double Zoom Lens Kit black

The Canon EOS Kiss M is also known as the Canon EOS M50 â€“ and this has been a very popular camera since its release. The Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III was able to leapfrog over the EOS M50 and the Sony a6400, which were the top two cameras when BCN+R published 2019's data.
