Venus Optics has officially announced a super-fast Laowa f/0/95 Argus range, designed for a variety of mounts including Micro Four Thirds, Sony E and Fujifilm X mount. This brand new range seems to be designed to give users access to super-fast glass â€“ and presumably at the affordable prices that Laowa is known for (although no pricing information is available as of yet). 

These brand new pieces of glass include the Laowa 25mm f/0.95 for Micro Four Thirds mount, the Laowa 33mm f/0.95 for Fujifilm X mount and the Laowa 35mm f/0/9.5 and Laowa 45mm f/0.95 for Sony E mount.
