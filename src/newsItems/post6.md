CES 2021: Kingston has announced a new modular desktop card reader dock, named the Workflow Station, and a selection of compatible card reader modules. The aim is to speed up your file transfers by enabling multiple memory cards or USB storage devices to simultaneously transfer content to a PC or Mac.

The Workflow Station connects to your computer via a 10Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C connection, and each card reader module slots into one of the dock's four bays, each of which contains its own USB Type-C plug. This enables you to use the reader modules as conventional standalone card readers linked via a Type-C cable, though each reader module can only transfer at 5Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 1 speed.
